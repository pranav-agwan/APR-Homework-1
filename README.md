# Titanic Disaster Analysis in R

This repository contains the analysis of the Titanic disaster survival data performed using R. The analysis is documented in the `Homework-1.pdf` file, which was generated from a `QMD` (Quarto Markdown) file .

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, focusing on passenger survival based on various factors such as class, age, sex, and survival status. 
## Contents

*   **`Homework-1.pdf`**: The complete analysis document in PDF format. It includes:
    *   **Data Loading and Preview**: Loading the Titanic dataset and displaying the first few rows to understand the data structure.
    *   **Data Structure**: Checking the dataset's structure.
    *   **Variable Descriptions**:
        *   **Class**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Crew) - Factor variable.
        *   **Sex**: Passenger's sex (Male, Female) - Factor variable.
        *   **Age**: Age group of the passenger (Child, Adult) - Factor variable.
        *   **Survived**: Survival status of the passenger (Yes, No) - Factor variable.
        *   **Freq**: Count of passengers in the specific group - Numeric variable.
    *   **Graphical Analysis**:
        *   Bar plot visualizing the number of male and female passengers who survived or did not survive.
        *   Interpretation of the bar plot, including approximate counts of survivors and non-survivors by sex.

*   **`Homework 1.qmd`**: The Quarto Markdown file used to generate the `Homework-1.pdf` file.  

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis:

1.  Clone this repository in your desired location

2.  Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed.

3.  Open the `Homework 1.qmd` file in RStudio or your preferred Quarto editor.

4.  Render the `QMD` file to generate the PDF report:

    This will produce an updated `Homework-1.pdf` file.

## Key Findings from the PDF

*   **Survival by Sex**: The analysis includes a bar plot showing the survival counts for males and females. Key observations include:
    *   Approximately 1350-1400 males did not survive.
    *   Approximately 350-400 males survived.
    *   Approximately 100-150 females did not survive.
    *   Approximately 350-400 females survived.
